#Categories --> things that we rely a lot on
  categories need to have other categories inside of them
  HR category inside of Department category.
  Helps them better organize work they have to do.

#Lock-down the info
  Not all employees should see other employees files
  Only admins should be able to see all employees files
  Employees should be able to give other employees permission to see/edit the note/upload

#Colors
  likes blue a lot
    blue for primary
    red for secondary

#Pictures
  When we upload pictures, we need to specify info on the pictures
    -> be able to add a description on pictures
    -> be able to potentially tag a location along with all notes (geolocation)
